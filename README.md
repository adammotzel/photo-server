# Photo Server

A quick side project to serve photos of my dog on a web app to anyone connected to my home Wi-Fi. The code uses:

- `fastapi` for serving the app.
- `html` for some vanilla webpages (thanks ChatGPT ðŸ™‚).
- `starlette` for middleware (e.g., login/password).

Users can view and upload photos in the app's photo gallery.

To run the app yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adammotzel/photo-server.git
cd photo-server
```

2. Create a `.env` file in project root:

    1. `PW`: The app's login password.
    2. `NAME`: The name of your pet, to be injected into the HTML templates.
    3. `PYTHONPATH`: Absolute path to the project.
    4. `SECRET`: The key used for the middleware.

```bash
PW='password'
NAME='Scooby-doo'
PYTHONPATH='/absolute/path/to/your/project'
SECRET='somesupersecretkey'
```

3. Set up a virtual environment (I used Python `3.12.8`):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the app:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will launch on host `0.0.0.0` (all available network interfaces) and port `8000` by default. You can change this in the `run.py` file.

If you want to serve the app to other devices connected to your home Wi-Fi (like I did), you may need to allow inbound traffic on the port for private networks. This can be configured in your machine's firewall settings.

Other in-network devices can access the app at `<local IP address>:<port>`. You can try setting the local domain to something more user-friendly, if you'd like.


## Optional

You can also run the app from a Docker container using the `Dockerfile` in project root.

```bash
docker build -t photo-server .
docker container run --name photo-server-container --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/src/photos,target=/app/src/photos -p 8000:8000 photo-server
```
